          <h3>📋 What's this form for?</h3>
          <p>
            This form helps us understand you better so we can build and scale a platform that best serves your real needs—no guesswork. Our private beta will be for women only, but with your support, we can expand it to more communities, so regardless of how you identify, please respond as completely and honestly as you can! There are no wrong answers—only missed opportunities.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We will be opening the first round of our private beta launch to only 30 members—the faster and more complete your survey, the higher you get on the list! We will announce updates via email (see terms and conditions below) and you'll know then if you've been shortlisted.
          </p>
          
          
          <h3>📝 Terms & Consent</h3>
