          "Third places"—your home away from home—have been disappearing over the last few years, whether you realise it or not. Your favourite hangouts are either gone or endangered. <strong>There are crowds of people everywhere, but instead of feeling excited, you're chronically anxious. And lonely.</strong>

        <p>
          The disparate post-pandemic culture has left you <strong>feeling misunderstood, disconnected, distracted, unfulfilled.</strong> So you being you, you try to get to know yourself and others better.

        <p>
          And suddenly, you're learning about ND, ADHD, OCD, NPD ... the acronyms; the labels; and most of all, the consequences of your awareness of your Self and of others, without specialist, <strong>human-first & heart-centred guidance</strong>, is overwhelming.
