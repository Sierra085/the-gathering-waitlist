      <h2>Finding your way home — to yourself, with others.</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>The Gathering</strong> is a one-stop online platform for women seeking balance, purpose and belonging. 
        Our mission is to empower ambitious, high-performing individuals who often feel anxious, disconnected or overwhelmed —
        by creating a safe environment where they can <strong>co-work, co-learn and co-live</strong> with others on the same journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside The Gathering, members will find:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Caves</strong> — guided virtual co-working sessions led by trained hosts for deep focus and accountability.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>The Lounge</strong> — a 24-hour drop-in space to stay connected between sessions.</li> -->
        <!-- <li><strong>Workshops & Bonus Caves</strong> — live themed gatherings for learning and self-care.</li> -->
        <li><strong>Resources</strong> — a growing marketplace of templates, prompts, courses and tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Forum & Directory</strong> — to find collaborators, mentors and expert support.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At its heart, The Gathering is about <strong>self-compassion through connection</strong> —
        a digital sanctuary for women to grow, heal and thrive together.
      </p>

        It didn't happen immediately. You might've had a gut feeling but you were so embedded in the simulation that you couldn't imagine differently.

        Then you woke up one day and suddenly, you couldn't recognise your surroundings. You didn't even know why you were there in the first place.

        And no matter how hard you try, you can't seem to reconcile the person you are now with the world that no longer recognises you.

        "Third places"—your home away from home—have been disappearing over the last few years, whether you realise it or not. Your favourite hangouts are either gone or endangered. There are crowds of people everywhere, but instead of feeling excited, you're chronically anxious. And alone. Then you go home, and while it's peaceful, you feel isolated.

        There are millions of us across Southeast Asia alone that are trying to find our way back "home". AI, gentrification XXXXX. And despite grassroots and even national efforts to try and solve this problem, the fact is: You're on the "struggle bus". You can barely find the time to get a haircut, what more coordinate an afternoon learning the art of kintsugi with your best friends.
